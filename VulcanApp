# VulcanApp Workshop

You will need to have Meteor, node, npm, and nvm on your computers. Please make sure to install these first. Also, if you don't have a Github account, create one. You will post your work to a repo you create on Github.

For tonight's event, you will start off with the Vulcan framework and work to build a package that pulls and ennumerates forthcoming Meteor-NY events into a React component. The event list you will create is read-only. The list should be visible to all website visitors; access should be unrestricted.

The Vulcan framework can be found at https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan. From a terminal session on your computer, pull down a copy with `git clone https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan.git`

You can find information about the Meetup API at https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/ and tonight's exercise **does not** require an API key.

You can create your package as a Meteor package or an npm package. You're encouraged to select one and go with it. 

Make sure to commit your changes as you work. And make sure you push your changes to your Github repo. When you're ready, fork this project (https://github.com/Meteor-NY/VulcanApp/), and a link to your repo in the "Meetup_Packages.md" file. Put (meteor) or (npm) at the end of your link to indicate which package type it represents.

Happy coding!!

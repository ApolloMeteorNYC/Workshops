# Workshops
This is a series of community-developed workshops that can be given at Meetups or other community gatherings for novice and intermediate Meteor enthusiasts. Each workshop will consist of a slide deck that can be used by the gathering organizer, sample code, and and organized set of external resources that students can use to further their understanding. These workshops are intended to be used as both primary as well as supplemental programming for community organizers.

# Meetup Package List

Hack Night (6/29/2017) exercise involved creating a Meteor or npm package that ennumerates upcoming events for a meetup and makes them visible in React components. The exercise left it up to the developer to determine what data to use, and how to display it. The one caveat is the package must be usable by Meteor developers in their applications. It's implementation should follow the Meteor way.

Please indicate works in progress with an asterisk at the end of the line.

Expected format is:

`<<repo link>> (npm | meteor)<<*>>`

ex. 

`https://github.com/alimgafar/nextMeetup.git (meteor)*`

`https://github.com/alanning/allMeetupEvents.git (npm)`
